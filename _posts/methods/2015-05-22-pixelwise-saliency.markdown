Taobao Commidity Dataset (TCD): [[Images](http://vision.sysu.edu.cn/vision_sysu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Imgs_TCD.zip)] [[Masks](http://vision.sysu.edu.cn/vision_sysu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mask_TCD.zip)]   (click [here](http://vision.sysu.edu.cn/projects/taobao-commodity-dataset/) or picture below to see more details) 

TCD contains 800 commodity images from the shops on the Taobao website. The ground truth masks of the TCD dataset are obtained by inviting common sellers of Taobao website to annotate their commodities, i.e., masking salient objects that they want to show from their exhibition. These images include all kinds of commodity with and without human models, thus having complex backgrounds and scenes with highly complex foregrounds.
